   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to my_test_package's documentation!
===========================================

This package does some neat stuff!  It's features include:

Citing this code
----------------
There's no way to cite this code right now.  But it would be great if you acknowledge Erika Wagoner if you use it.  Someday I hope to put it up on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_, though...
